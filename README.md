How to run the game:
!! Make sure the terminal is resized to be really big !!

In the player vs AI mode:
In the terminal navigate to the directory of the game and run this command:

dotnet run (if you run into an issue where the playing fields looks distorted or have any issues you need to resize your terminal window :D, if despite resizing the game still refuses to run, use the "clear" command to clear the terminal, also resizing the terminal window while playing is not recomended)
